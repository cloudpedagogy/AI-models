Machine Learning is a subset of AI where machines can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a further subset of Machine Learning that utilizes neural networks with several layers (\"deep\" structures) to make sense of data.\n",

Unsupervised learning is where the model must find patterns and relationships in datasets without any labels. Reinforcement learning is where an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results, guided by rewards (reinforcements).\n",

        "The bias-variance tradeoff is a central problem in supervised learning. Ideally, a model should have low bias (not making assumptions about the data) and low variance (changing a lot in response to changes in input data). However, in practice, reducing one can increase the other. The tradeoff is finding a balance so that the model generalizes well and doesn't overfit or underfit.\n",

        "Cross-validation is a resampling method used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. It's useful to get an unbiased estimate of model generalization on unseen data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Common problems include overfitting (model performs well on training data but not on unseen data), underfitting (model is too simple to capture patterns in data), lack of quality data, difficulties in feature selection, and the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is feature engineering?**\n",

The validation set is used to prevent overfitting of the model. It's a check to ensure the model doesn't just memorize the training data but learns to generalize from it."
