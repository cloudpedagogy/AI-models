Grouping the machine learning models based on their types and characteristics:

Supervised Learning Models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
7. Naive Bayes
8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
9. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
10. LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)
11. CatBoost (Categorical Boosting)
12. Ridge Classification (Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization)
13. Lasso Classification (Logistic Regression with L1 Regularization)

Unsupervised Learning Models:
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. k-Means Clustering
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Regularization Techniques:
1. Elastic Net
2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
3. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

Note: Decision Boundary Estimation (DBE) is not a standard machine learning model, but rather a general concept related to classification problems, where the boundary that separates different classes is estimated. It is not a specific algorithm on its own but rather an aspect of classification models.
