        "Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a type of neural network architecture developed by OpenAI. It is based on the Transformer model, which was introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" in 2017. GPT takes advantage of the transformer's attention mechanism and leverages the power of deep learning to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Here are some key features of the GPT architecture**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Pre-training: GPT is \"pre-trained\" on a massive corpus of text data using a language modeling objective. This means it learns to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words. By doing so, it gains a broad understanding of the language's grammar, context, and semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transformer architecture: GPT is built upon the Transformer model, which allows it to handle long-range dependencies in text and capture contextual relationships effectively. This is achieved through self-attention mechanisms that weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Fine-tuning: After pre-training, GPT can be \"fine-tuned\" on specific downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, language translation, sentiment analysis, question-answering, etc. This fine-tuning process adapts the model to the task at hand and allows it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros of GPT**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Versatility: GPT is a versatile model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks without major architectural changes. This makes it highly efficient in tackling different challenges in the field of natural language processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Contextual understanding: GPT excels at understanding context in language, as it takes into account the entire context of a sentence or text, not just isolated words. This allows it to generate more coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. State-of-the-art performance: GPT has achieved impressive results on various NLP benchmarks and competitions, showcasing its capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Transfer learning: Pre-training on a large corpus of text allows GPT to capture general language patterns, which can be beneficial when fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets. This transfer learning approach often leads to better performance with less data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons of GPT**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Computational requirements: GPT is a large model with a significant number of parameters, which demands substantial computational resources for both training and inference. This can be a limitation for smaller research groups or those without access to high-performance hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Large memory footprint: Due to its size, deploying GPT in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices or certain edge devices may be challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Lack of interpretability: Like many deep learning models, GPT's inner workings can be difficult to interpret. Understanding why the model made a specific decision might not be straightforward, especially in complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use GPT**:\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT is an excellent choice in the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Natural Language Generation: When you need to generate coherent and contextually relevant natural language text, GPT is a suitable option. It can be used for chatbots, text completion, text summarization, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transfer Learning: If you have a specific NLP task with a limited amount of labeled data, GPT's pre-training and fine-tuning approach can be highly beneficial. You can use a pre-trained GPT model and fine-tune it on your task, leveraging its general language understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Complex NLP tasks: GPT can be used for complex tasks that require an understanding of context and long-range dependencies in text, such as machine translation, question-answering, sentiment analysis, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Research and experimentation: For researchers and practitioners in the NLP domain, GPT provides a powerful baseline model and can be used for benchmarking and experimentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if you are dealing with very specific tasks or have limited computational resources, using a smaller, task-specific model might be more appropriate. Additionally, in some cases, traditional machine learning techniques or simpler models can still be effective and efficient for certain NLP tasks."

        "   - `tokenizer.encode(prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\")`: Tokenizes the `prompt_text` and converts it into a PyTorch tensor of input IDs. The input IDs represent the encoded tokens of the prompt text.\n",
        "   - `model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)`: Generates text starting from the given input IDs using the GPT-2 model. The `max_length` parameter controls the maximum number of tokens in the generated text, and `num_return_sequences=1` indicates that we want only one sequence of generated text.\n",
        "   - `tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)`: Decodes the output tensor from the GPT-2 model into human-readable text. The `skip_special_tokens=True` argument skips any special tokens (e.g., `<PAD>`, `<UNK>`, etc.) present in the generated text.\n",
        "   - The generated text is returned from the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer:\n",
        "   - `model_name = \"gpt2\"`: Specifies the name of the pre-trained GPT-2 model to be used. You can choose from `\"gpt2\"`, `\"gpt2-medium\"`, `\"gpt2-large\"`, or `\"gpt2-xl\"`. The size of the model increases with the suffix (e.g., \"medium\", \"large\").\n",
