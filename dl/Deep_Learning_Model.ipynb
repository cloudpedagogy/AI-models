        "   Machine learning is a broader concept, encompassing all methods and techniques for teaching computers to perform tasks by learning patterns in data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that specifically deals with artificial neural networks with several layers (\"deep\" structures). These deep networks are capable of learning complex patterns from large amounts of data.\n",

        "\n",
        "   Deep learning has been successful in a variety of areas, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, among others. The rise in computational power, the availability of large datasets, and advancements in neural network algorithms have contributed to its popularity.\n",

Lower layers might learn to recognize simple patterns, like edges in an image, while deeper layers combine these simple patterns to recognize more complex features, like shapes or objects. The more layers, the more complexity can be captured by the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "   The vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty encountered during the training of deep neural networks using gradient-based optimization methods. As the gradient of the loss function is backpropagated to earlier layers, repeated multiplication of small numbers (gradients) can make the gradient exceedingly small. Consequently, weights of the initial layers change very little, and the network fails to learn effectively.\n",

Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and unseen data."
